                                Like most good things in life, losing body fat requires effort - and thereâ€™s no shortcut! A good workout plan coupled with a healthy lifestyle makes the job easier. Burning fat by cardiovascular training and facilitating growth of lean muscle tissue by strength training are the key. Here's our list of effective tips to bust that fat.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Burn fat everywhere</h3>
                                 <p>
                               Many of us believe that losing fat is simply getting rid of the fat deposits around the stomach region and doing a thousand sit-ups or crunches a day will help us lose flab. This is not true as it will merely overtrain our abdominal muscles while the fat deposits around the stomach region will barely get affected.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most experienced Personal Trainers and Bodybuilders will tell you that fat from the stomach region is always the first to accumulate and the last to dissipate. Therefore it is important to follow a well planned strength training routine that consists of compound exercises which focus on large muscle groups along with a range of cardiovascular exercises. This ensures you burn fat throughout your body and see visible results much faster - without the risk of overtraining one muscle group. 
                                </p>


                                <h3> Increase the intensity of cardio</h3>
                                <p>
                                <img src="img/articles/cycling.jpg" class="img_wrap">
You work out zealously. You spin, run and do the elliptical, but youâ€™re not losing fat like you used to when you started. The reason - when following the same cardiovascular activity or a certain routine of cardiovascular activities day in and day out, your body gets accustomed to these exercises and the results diminish. Your body adapts to this routine and you hit a plateau. 

                                </p>
                                <p>
This is a common problem with a large percentage of fitness enthusiasts and there is a simple fix to this problem - mix it up! The human body adapts to changes over a period of time and in order to see results regularly we need to keep our bodies guessing. Increasing the intensity of cardio and using different forms of cardiovascular training over a period of time keeps the body guessing and prevents it from adapting to the strenuous exercise routine you follow - this in turn ensures constant burning of fat and development of lean muscle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
Alternating between different forms of cardiovascular training such as continuous, interval and fartlek training has proven to be the most efficient way to avoid hitting plateaus.

                                Boost your metabolism
                                </h3>

                                <p>
                                 <img src="img/articles/running.jpg" class="img_wrap">Our metabolism plays an important part in the process of burning excess fat stored in our bodies. An individual with an increased metabolic rate burns fat faster and much more efficiently than one who has a lower metabolic rate. Certain aspects of our metabolism are related to our genetics and can not be changed. However it is possible to increase our metabolic rate by various means.
                                 </p>
                                <p>
A quick session of exercise upon waking up early in the morning is a proven and highly efficient way to kick-start your metabolism for the day. A well balanced and nutritious breakfast is more important than any other meal that follows and must never be skipped. Follow this up with small and regular meals to ensure a good metabolic rate throughout the day.
                                </p>

Hot spices like cayenne pepper, black pepper and cumin are also known to help increase metabolism. Drinking enough water is another key aspect which ensures a well regulated nutrient flow throughout the body.

                                <img src="img/articles/food.jpg" class="img_wrap"> Following a diet which suits your body and meets your calorific needs is a key aspect when trying to lose fat. Any errors on this part can be the difference between success and failure. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats are vital macronutrients and must be consumed in the right amount, from proper sources. 
                                 </p>
                                <p>
You donâ€™t need to slash your calorific intake in order to strip the body of fat. This causes the metabolic rate to drop and can lead to muscle tissue being broken down by the body in order to generate energy. A high metabolic rate plays a significant role in fat loss, therefore small regular meals which have been calculated to meet the bodyâ€™s needs are a must.
                                 </p>
                                <p>
A slight, calculated calorific deficit is what does the trick. The acceptable rule here is that a 500 calorie deficit each day is a safe way to lose fat. 1 pound of body weight is made up of 3,500 calories, therefore a 500 calorie deficit/day will result in the loss of 1 pound of bodyweight per week and this adds up to approximately 2 kilograms of bodyweight a month. 
                                 </p>
                                <p>
Following a proper diet and workout schedule can ensure that these 2 kilograms of lost bodyweight are fat and not your hard earned muscle mass.
                                </p>

                                    A rough estimate of your daily calorific needs can be calculated using the Harry Benedict Equation below:

                                    At the end of the day we must remember that eating right and exercising is a lifestyle change. Fat loss and maintenance of a healthy fat percentage has to be seen as a long term goal and once achieved should be maintained.
