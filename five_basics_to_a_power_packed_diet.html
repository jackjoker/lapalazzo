It is often considered a challenge to plan a diet in order to achieve specific fitness goals. You have to account for your fitness preferences and the effects each diet plan will have on your body. To achieve the body you dream of, you also need a diet that keeps you energised throughout the day. Here are a few basics that can help you pack extra power into your diet.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>1. Know your food</h3>
                                 <p>
                                <img src="img/articles/diet.jpg" class="img_wrap">For the production of energy and proper functioning, your body needs nutrition from various food groups like carbohydrates, proteins and fats.  Carbohydrates are broken down and assimilated by the body to produce energy. Complex carbohydrates are the go-to sources for energy as they break down slowly providing a steady release of energy which can last up to your next meal. They are a very important constituent of a diet and a well planned carbohydrate intake can ensure you achieve your goals.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   Proteins are the building blocks of muscles. Muscles derive most of their nutrition from proteins. Ideal protein intake differs from individual to individual, depending on the lifestyle and fitness regimes. Professional athletes and bodybuilders consume up to 1-2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight. It is important to note that only proteins do not comprise a healthy diet, they are only a part of it. Right supplementation such as Kryptonite Real Whey can play a great role in empowering your journey on this front.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  The final macronutrient of a healthy diet is Fats. These are more important than we think. Along with playing an important role in maintaining the hormonal balance and proper functioning of the body, the right kind of fats also assist fat loss! Fats exist in several forms and it is important to understand which are harmful and which are good for the human body. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are good for the body as they can be digested relatively easily and also lower cholesterol levels. So next time you plan a diet, be sure to include the right amount of fats from desirable sources.
                                </p>

                                <h3>2. Choose an appropriate diet plan</h3>
                                <p>
                                <img src="img/articles/food_pyramid.jpg" class="img_wrap">
Choosing an appropriate diet is an important step in ensuring you have adequate energy to go about your daily routine. While choosing a diet plan, take into account the AMDR (Adult Minimum Daily Requirements) for various nutrients. Next you must take into account the type of exercise regime you follow. It is important to remember that AMDR guidelines are based on adults with a sedentary lifestyle, not highly active adults with intense workout regimes. The diet should be flexible to suit your fitness and nutritional requirements. For instance a person aiming to bulk-up and put on quality mass will generally opt for a 40% carbohydrate, 40% proteins and 20% fat ratio in their diet. The specifics vary from individual to individual and slight changes can mean the difference between success and failure.
                                </p>
                                <p>
Therefore planning the appropriate diet for yourself is a careful and technical process. Unless you have the expertise, it is always advised to consult an experienced dietician to get this right. If in doubt, use our Kryptonite Transformation Programme to get your diet right. One of our experienced dieticians will guide you through the basics and will design a custom diet to suit your specific needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
Alternating between different forms of cardiovascular training such as continuous, interval and fartlek training has proven to be the most efficient way to avoid hitting plateaus.
                                </p>

                                <h3>
                               3. Divide your meals into smaller portions
                                </h3>

                                <p>
                                 <img src="img/articles/food_box.jpg" class="img_wrap">The daily food intake should be divided into 6-8 smaller meals spread evenly throughout the day rather than the traditional three meal diets. The nutrients should be spread out in the right proportions as timing is key. For example, breakfast should be a heavy nutritious meal as it provides you energy that lasts all morning. A major percentage of the daily carbohydrate intake should be accounted for between breakfast and post-workout meals.
                                 </p>
                                <p>
Plan meals for the latter part of your day according to your specific goals. The last meal should contain the least amount of calories, as the body requires a negligible amount of energy while sleeping. Pre-bed is a good time to add a slow digesting protein supplement to your diet plan. This ensures that the metabolic rate is high, and your muscles are replenished with proteins while you sleep.
                                </p>
                              

                                 <h3>4. Don’t skip meals</h3>

                                <p>
                               


                                <img src="img/articles/food-time.jpg" class="img_wrap"> Timing and frequency of meals is a key aspect of achieving your fitness goals and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Skipping meals can have adverse effects on your body and will hinder your progress irrespective of whether your goal is to lose fat or to gain/maintain muscle mass.
                                 </p>
                                <p>
Smaller portions every 2 1/2 to 3 hours will ensure a higher metabolic rate and constant nutrition to the recovering muscles thus maintaining energy levels throughout the day. This is ideal for people aiming to burn fat or gain muscle mass. It is understood the diets will differ for different goals but regular meals are a key.
                                 </p>
                                <p>
When we skip meals, the body slows down our metabolism to try and cope with the energy demands with limited resources - thus breaking down muscle mass to derive energy while storing fat as a reserve.

                                 </p>
                                <p>

Sticking to regular meals while living a hectic lifestyle can sometimes be tough and a convenient way of coping with this is to use a quality Meal Replacements such as Kryptonite Pure Mass or Kryptonite Opti Mass - scientifically formulated products to ensure you get all the nutrition your body deserves!
                                </p>

                                  <h3>5. Stick to your diet</h3>

                                <p>
                                 <img src="img/articles/junk-food.jpg" class="img_wrap">  The most important part of a diet - stick to it! 
                               </p>
                                 <p>
                                Many of us believe that following a diet is similar to going to office - 5 days a week and the weekend is free. Others believe in 1 cheat day every week or 1 cheat meal a week. Depending on your fitness goals, 1 cheat meal a week can be acceptable if you stick to your diet throughout the week and if it is consumed in moderation. For example a couple of slices of pizza will be a reasonable cheat meal while a large pizza will be a mistake! 
                               </p>

                                <p>
                               Cheat meals are more acceptable for individuals aiming to bulk-up or gain muscle mass. If your aim is to lose fat then cheat meals must be avoided as much as possible. Most fast foods have high fat, sugar and salt content, which will do more harm than good to your body. Oily and salty foods also make you drowsy and lethargic after consumption, rendering the opposite effect on your diet plan.
                               </p>

                                <p>
                                A strong will is the key to ensuring that you stick to your diet plan. Contrary to popular belief, a strict diet does not have to be boring. A strict diet is where your macronutrient quantities and sources for each meal must be worked out. Using flavours and spices to cook an interesting meal is completely acceptable! 
                               </p>
