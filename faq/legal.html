                         Agreement is a legal document which is executed between the builder and the customer, after the customer has paid 30% (Assumed Values) of the booking amount of the apartment. This document will have the terms and conditions of the seller and the buyer after the purchase of the property. This is a basic document on which the bank or any financial institution will lend money to the customer. But this is not considered as a final document when it comes to the title of the property. Sale deed is the final and very important document which authenticates that the title of the property is conveyed to the buyer. The document can be procured from the Sub-Registrar’s office by paying necessary stamp duty and registration charges. Presently, the stamp duty is 6.72% and registration charges are 1% of the total amount. These charges are subject to change as per government norms.
